# Time-Series-forecasting
## Project Overview
+ Objective: Predict sales for 50 items across 10 stores over a 3-month period.
+ Dataset: Utilized 5 years of historical sales data for model training and evaluation.
+ Techniques Used: Seasonality analysis, trend decomposition, and various time series models.
+ Models Explored: ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks.
+ Evaluation: Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and robustness. <br>
## Key Features
+ Seasonality Analysis: Identified and adjusted for seasonal patterns in the sales data.
+ Trend Decomposition: Analyzed and decomposed the trends within the time series to understand underlying patterns.
+ Model Comparison: Evaluated the performance of ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM models in forecasting sales.
+ Optimization Techniques: Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and generalization.
